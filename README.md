# stand_alone_scripts

These scripts are stand alone and are designed to be that way.
They are made for Proxmox!

They are open and available for review, everything is as simple as they need to be to run successfully.

Run Everything with: bash -c "$(wget -qLO - https://whatevertheurlisongithub.com)"

These are very much in early development, and I am not responsible for anything breaking. Use at your own risk.

## Currently Available:

### Debian LXC install:

```
bash -c "$(wget -qLO - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cindustriesio/stand_alone_scripts/refs/heads/main/proxmox/lxc/debian_lxc_git.sh)"
```

Any questions or comments just ask!
